The well known snake game but with locomotives and waggons instead of snake.

It is perfect for embedding it into your website - just add header and footer.

## How to play

* Eat the red dot to get larger

## Setup
* Place files where you need them
* Add header and footer to the two ```.html``` files, merge them with existing tags
* Surround everything with ```<html></html>```
* Don't miss the ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` at the top
